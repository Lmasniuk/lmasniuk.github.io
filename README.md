# Logan's Personal Website

## About
I have created this repo to play around with Github Pages and a personal profile site. I originally built it with basic HTML and CSS, then I switched over to recreating it with React using Vite. I took the Vite build files and put them in this repo, and voila! 
There are definitely other ways to accomplish the same thing, but this is the result of me just playing around with a few things and getting something working ðŸ˜„
